<p>I was shot in Vietnam by an old man. He said he was seventy two years old when I managed to communicate with him using sign language. Even if he could speak I might not have understood him since he had only a few teeth. He was smiling and good natured. Wearing a yellow vest that hung loosely on his bones, he stood straight but leaned forward a little. He walked haltingly, as if each step caught him from falling. I was on the ground as he approached me. I looked up at him thinking what he might have been in a previous age. He was 24 years old in 1967. How he managed to survive without injury or illness to this day puzzled me, and still does. But maybe that is his secret, that he learned long ago to let go. He had no grudge against me personally, clearly an American, he approached me calmly. The sun was behind him and was blinding me. I thought he was a clever adversary to come at me from from that direction. But he kept smiling, as if he knew me, though he could not have. As I waited for the encounter to climax, I felt a memory from childhood wash over over me.</p>

<p>I was in Crete. With my grandparents. The sun was beating down on the bare rocks and igniting the air with the fumes of lavender and thyme. I was an ephebos, just figuring the world out for myself, trying to derive the equations of living from the tumult of personal experience. We came across a monument, almost Soviet in its stark design. It stood at the end of a stone staircase leading to the top of a small hill. A pedestal built from stone blocks had a cross carved into it. Atop  stood a concrete diving eagle gripping a swastika in its talons. I asked my grandparents why the Greeks let that statue stand. Weren't the Nazis the enemy? How many times did I hear of the bad things done by the storm troopers. Why did they leave this monument to their oppressors? But my grandfather said the past is over. And no matter what these soldiers did, they were children once too. They had parents and families who mourned them. My grandparents too had learned to let go long ago.</p>

<p>And as that yellow clad man loomed over me, he smiled and extended a hand to help me up. I creaked standing up and he turned his camera around to show me the shot. The sun dappled shadows were a camouflage over my skewed, cross legged crouch. He had processed the image with a dramatic black and white tonality and my shape looked liked an abstract puzzle that was part Mondrian.</p>

<p>I showed him the shot I had of him. No play of light, no clever compositon, no artistic merit. But someone told me that art is born of suffering. And clearly this wizened, toothless, wordless man had sufferred for many people and many years. And yet he still could smile and prosecute the living..</p>

<p>I wondered how desparately we need order to make sense of life's chaos. We do anything to follow a simple order.</p>

<a id="a-different-kind-of-heat" class="anchor" href="#a-different-kind-of-heat" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Different Kind of Heat</h3>

<p>4 showers a day. That's what Ha Noi pushes on you in July. But it's not a hot humidity that suffocates. You do not feel like your blood stopped flowing. That kind of punishment comes off the Atlantic mercilessly in the summer - giant rolls of heat flop over the land from the East coast. Breathing can sometimes feel like swimming. In Ha Noi, the heat feels more delicate. A whisper of a wind comes and goes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="find-a-b52" class="anchor" href="#find-a-b52" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Find a B52</h3>

<p>My guide is Cong. I asked him where the B52 went down and he smiles. Without dropping his gaze or moving his head, he reaches to the counter and points to a map. "Here", he says. "Bygones be bygones". He looks so different than me. Pockmarked skin below delicate eyes frames a bulbous nose and proud lips. He waits. Then smiles and nods. I'm gone. Out the door into the balmy breath that passes for a breeze. I march on. The map has a fingerprint on the destination. I pass thousands of Vietnamese and am ignored. They move forward. Some quick and others slow. Some just loiter, squat and watch the others.</p>

<p>I can pass for an Arab. Once I walked their streets, also unnoticed. And when the towers fell , I asked why but could not find an answer. We had not mined their land and harbors. B52s never darkened their skies. Napalm and agent orange never touched their skin. But here in Vietnam, these memories are real. How can Cong not see me as a bully? How can he not hate me? Why didnt't I have this lesson in school? But I am from the other side of the planet.</p>

<p>The B52 is ahead. A scarred carcass of metal is black in the sun. Cong sees it as an alien artifact. Pieces are laid out just so. Most are recognizable for the parts they were except for a tangled nest of scorched steel and aluminum. A strut juts out like a tree branch. At the end of it is a massive wheel with a shredded tire hanging from it. Ripe fruit is rotting nearby. Thankfully there are no human remains.</p>

<p>I march on. The streets are narrow in the Ba Dinh district. Spread your arms and you touch the buildings on both sides. Full of twisty passages all alike, I spend as much time looking at a map as I do the world. The alley opens up to a square pond. A marble balustrade with a Palladian design rings it at waist height. Several cafes decorate the streets and Vietnamese sit on plastic chairs low to the ground. Furniture made for children. Their gaze hardly stops at the remnants of a B52 stuck in the pond since 1972. A tree has rooted in the fragment of fuselage. A single trunk thinner than a baseball bat and less than 10 feet tall, it's no more than a few years old. What happened that a seed finally took root in a hostile machine? Life prevails over death. Killing does not make sense-death will always lose.</p>

<h3>
<a id="urban-warfare" class="anchor" href="#urban-warfare" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Urban Warfare</h3>

<p>Crossing the street in Hanoi is an art form. To begin with, the street lights sometimes are not in working worder. And even if they are working, the vehicles treat them as suggested driving hints rather than rules. Fortunately, most vehicles only have two wheels. Motor scooters are the preferred transportation device. They putter along and always accelerate and stop gracefully. Though this may reflect the careful skill of the drivers, it may also reflect weak engines and poor brakes. The scooters are a constant stream. Sometimes you can outrun them if you are a fast sprinter. Usually though, the best strategy is to let them see you making steady, small purposeful steps. When they see you, it's like you invited them to dance. They will follow your lead and move around you.</p>

<p>You step a foot off the curb and start crossing the street obliquely in the direction of traffic. You do not slow down, just keep walking and gradually merge with the traffic. Adjust your pace to time your crossing in between vehicles. In general, keep the pace steady. The drivers do not beep their horns because they know that will scare you. They just drift by you, sometimes just coasting. Their scooters have small wheels and this makes them maneuverable. They seem to enjoy their agility and they smile as they pass you. The first few times, it is unnerving because every step you take is a considered decision. You have to scan the environment and make an action plan for the next step. So it is more like hiking a technical trail rather than walking on a sidewalk. You have to keep your wits about you and take nothing for granted. There is nothing automatic or formulaic. Each crossing is different. And crossing a street is different for every person. A bunch of people crossing the same street will each do it in their own way, with their own style. But in every case, a street crossing is a choreographed give and take between pedestrian and driver. The interaction cannot be rushed or done without mutual consideration. Statistics, if they are to be believed, say that the Vietnamese have the fewest accidents in the SE Asian mainland per capita and per 100000 vehicles. Perhaps this is a telling clue about the Vietnamese - that they are more careful about life and respect each other as humans.</p>

<p>What secret enables in the Vietnamese their success? After domination by the Japanese in the second World War, they struggled against colonial imperialism. Finally they achieved their independence in 1954. But still they were subject to political and military forces much greater than their own. The land and the people were devastated by a civil war driven by the wealth and interests of foreign powers. Not until the mid 1970s did Vietnam emerge from a suffocating blanket of constant war. But they did not receive war reparations. They were not rebuilt as was Europe by the Marshall Plan. They were not even given subprime loans. They had no industry to attract outside investors. Foreign tourism did not flourish to infuse and fertilize their currency with stability.</p>

<p>But in the past 4 decades they have developed a bustling nation with skyscrapers. Ha Noi means the 'city between two rivers'. The marks of burgeoning wealth are appearing - a shopping mall in the historic district that was transplanted from 5th Ave in NY, a jewelry store whose facade recalls the faceted and prismatic quality of a diamond, a Rolls Royce dealership.  Amid these icebergs of wealth, there are still crowds and herds living on much less. Surely there is also a dark side. Though I was approached by courtesans, they were not loud, garish or pushy. Men offering a 'good smoke' or referring to a nearby available 'happy ending' were always smiling, soft spoken and quick to recognize a declined offer with a nod of their head. They did not not stop smiling or change their demeanor though.  At night, the streets are busy and you do not feel stress though the tempo is no less than any European metropolis. There are few signs of vandalism, discontent, or predation. There is a disconnect in crossing a busy New York street but finding the occupants polite. When they sit at a cafe (which are numerous and never out of a sightline in the the historic centre) the native Vietnamese are often reflective, contemplative and observing. When they interact, they seem cooperative , not adversarial. Like members of the same soccer team, they pass the ball to each other. Not as pugilists in an arena with a winner and a loser. Amidst all the chaos in the video game we play at in our lives, how did they not lose their zen quality? Even their dogs behave differently - cautious and inquisitive, rarely vocalizing - unlike so many dogs of the west intent on marking their territory and barking their dominance.</p>

<p>How is it that other nations equally impoverished have not followed this example, but instead excoriate themselves into destitution as they argue over religious differences.</p>
